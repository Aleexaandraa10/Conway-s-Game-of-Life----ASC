# **Conway's Game of Life - x86 Assembly Implementation**  

## ðŸ“– **Description**  
This project is an implementation of the famous **Conwayâ€™s Game of Life**, developed as part of the **Computer Architecture** course. The goal was to apply fundamental concepts related to **parallel processing, performance optimization, and memory manipulation** using Assembly language.  

The project was divided into three distinct problems, and I implemented **Problem 1 and Problem 3**, which are closely related. **Problem 1** involved creating and running a **Game of Life simulator**, while **Problem 3** focused on improving and optimizing the initial implementation.

### âœ… **Problem 1: Basic Game of Life Implementation**  
- **Initializing a grid** of variable size with live and dead cells.  
- **Applying evolution rules** based on the state of neighboring cells.  
- **Simulating multiple generations** to observe cellular population dynamics.  
- **Displaying the grid in the terminal** at each simulation step.  
- **Reading input data** from a predefined file.  

### âœ… **Problem 3: Optimization & Simulation Enhancements**  
- **Performance optimizations** using efficient data structures.  
- **Implementing an optimized version** that reduces execution time.  
- **Using low-level memory manipulation techniques** to speed up the simulation.  
- **Exploring parallelization** to run the simulation faster on multiple cores.
